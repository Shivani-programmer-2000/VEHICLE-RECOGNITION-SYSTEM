# 🚗 Vehicle Recognition System

An AI-powered Vehicle Recognition System built using YOLOv8 and Flask for real-time vehicle and license plate detection.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

This project uses deep learning to detect vehicles from images and video streams. The system is deployed as a Flask web application that allows users to upload images and visualize detected vehicles with bounding boxes and confidence scores.

The dataset was created and annotated using Roboflow and trained using YOLOv8 (Ultralytics).
